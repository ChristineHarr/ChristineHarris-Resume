        <p class="lead mb-4">Since I can remember, I have always been a shy and closed off girl, especially in new environments with people that I don’t know. But when I am able to get comfortable with someone and become friends with them, I am this new vocal person. I like to talk around people that I am comfortable with, maybe a little too much at times. One thing that I have realized over the past couple years is that I love to help and encourage others with things they are struggling with. I never realized I loved doing this until I got older and realized that there was more to myself than I thought was ever possible. In fact, I feel the most satisfaction when I at least know that I gave someone some insight to make them feel better about something. Since being very young, this was something that I never felt like I did with full confidence. I never felt comfortable enough to talk about my own problems, especially when I was in desperate need of help.  I always felt like I was being secretly judged and also because I was stubborn,I felt like I needed to deal with my problems on my own. Due to these personal factors,  I wanted to make sure that people who are ever in need of help don't feel the same way that I used to feel; feeling like that is one of the worst feelings ever. Making my own safeplace was and currently is something that is very important to me; a place where people can come and never have to worry about being judged. A place where I can be an ear to listen, a shoulder to cry on, or a resource to provide helpful information.
 I have always been more of a giver than a receiver, and at first it bothered me that I never felt the comfort of others like I gave to them. But then I realized that I would be completely willing to give up some of my personal needs, in order to help others, which I know is not the best nor the worst thing to do. Some people may be confused on how a person can help someone with problems that they have never experienced themselves. Well that is one of my skills, being able to put myself in situations that I haven’t been through myself. I know it is common knowledge, but not everyone can put themselves in another person's shoes and be able to help them. I can, however, do this.  What helps is that I am a very blunt person, I will tell someone something that they may not want to hear. I never say anything to be rude, but instead to inform someone on what it is that they are doing wrong or should do differently. There is nothing worse than someone trying to sugarcoat things or withhold certain information because they’re scared of how the other person may react. I have

        Challenges make you more responsible.  When I started high school I faced barriers in World History Honors. The thing that I was struggling with the most was asking for help, when it came to me not understanding certain topics. I didn’t want to ask for help because I felt like I should know what I am supposed to be doing, especially with being in honors. So I would sit in silence and not understand what I was being taught because I was scared of being judged. There were times when  I wanted to give up and I actually did. I shut off and personally didn’t care about me passing because I didn’t feel like I had the ability to do so. Having faith in myself was something that I lacked. My confidence had been shaken. 
 
utting my fears away and I began asking for help. I  attended office hours and shared my struggles with my teacher. I asked her explicit questions about the work that I did not understand. Missing assignments and resubmitting  my work. My lack of confidence in myself had hurt my chances at  success. . I knew what I could do better. I did just that, each time proving my uncertainties wrong. I began to notice a major change in my grades from 10th grade to 11th. I went from making low C’s and one D throughout the semesters to having A’s throughout both semesters. 
Overcoming this educational barrier in life was by not letting my grades suffer from me being scared to ask for clarification, which resulted in understanding what is being taught and receiving better grades.  Most importantly I gained confidence and learned that when you change horrible habits, you will see amazing changes.  No matter how hard something may seem, one thing that will get you through it is by having confidence in yourself and the work you put in. Me overcoming this barrier will help me in the long run. There will be nothing that will hold me from achieving what needs to be done. Listening is a great skill to have. This was not a skill that came natural to me. My parents would tell me that I had a short attention span and that I needed to sit down, focus, and listen. As a small child- no one wants to focus and listen. Not listening quickly became a problem. I found myself often in trouble and the issue was always the same- Christine you need to listen.

In middle school- I began to see the light. I knew that not being a good listener wasn’t serving me well. I shifted m y focus to really listening to my teachers and my parents. I saw my grades improving as well as the relationship with my parents. 

In high school my newly found listening skills were put to the test.when I enrolled in my first college course. During my sophomore year- I was enrolled into an Intro to Communications course. This course was

        I hate group work. I don’t like the feeling of others being responsible for the grade that I will receive on an assignment. In my 11th grade English my peers and I were tasked with a major assignment. I cringed when I heard my teacher say that we were going to be placed in groups of five. Not only was it group work- but it was also a debate- my second least favorite thing. I instantly recognized a few problems with my group. Three of the five classmates either didn’t understand, weren't paying attention, or were never at school The other two, myself included, were poised and ready to tackle this difficult task. 
Seeing the lack of participation from the group encouraged me to step up and delegate roles. My peers had a negative attitude about doing their work- but I knew that this would need to change quickly in order to earn successful grades. I became a teacher at that point of time.  I am able to become the leader when things need to be done, especially when I understand and love what I am doing. My way of staying motivated was my determination and wanting to get a good grade. I was relieved when the project ended and my team received a strong grade. I felt accomplished as a student who was able to overcome a tough obstacle. 
I realized that there will be times where you are put in situations where strong leadership skills are needed in order to get the job done. There was a time where I was in a meeting for a possible scholarship and we were put into small groups. It was easy to have
My favorite academic subject in school is English. My interest in English developed during my English 11: American Literature. I knew that doing well in English could help me in any career that I was interested in. Skills that I have learned from taking English class are pushing myself and being better at how I write things. Which is quite crazy that English would inspire me considering I didn’t always do well in my previous English classes in High School. I think me doing not that well in my previous classes inspired me to want to do better. I know I could do better, and that it would take more work and dedication. But I was ready for that challenge. 
What I have learned from my involvement in English is that achieving something is never an impossible thing to do. I say this because I didn’t express my full potential in 10th grade. I would half heartedly put in the effort that I know I could give. I was gladly able to pass both semesters with a B
